<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<h3>NUnit 3.0.0 Beta 1 - March 25, 2015</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>There is now a master windows installer for the framework, engine and console runner.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>We no longer create a separate framework build for .NET 3.5. The 2.0 and 3.5 builds were essentially the same, so the former should now be used under both runtimes.
<li>A new Constraint, <b>DictionaryContainsKeyConstraint</b>, may be used to test that a specified key is present in a dictionary.
<li><b>LevelOfParallelizationAttribute</b> has been renamed to <b>LevelOfParallelismAttribute</b>.
<li>The Silverlight runner now displays output in color and includes any text output created by the tests.
<li>The class and method names of each test are included in the output xml where applicable.
<li>String arguments used in test case names are now truncated to 40 rather than 20 characters.
</ul>

<h4>Engine</h4>

<ul>
<li>The engine API has now been finalized. It permits specifying a minimum version of the engine that a runner is able to use. The best installed version of the engine will be loaded. Third-party runners may override the selection process by including a copy of the engine in their installation directory and specifying that it must be used.
<li>The V2 framework driver now uses the event listener and test listener passed to it by the runner. This corrects several outstanding issues  caused by events not being received and allows selecting V2 tests to  be run from the command-line, in the same way that V3 tests are selected.
</ul>

<h4>Console</h4>

<ul>
<li>The console now defaults to not using shadowcopy. There is a new option
<b>--shadowcopy</b> to turn it on if needed.
</ul>

<h4>Issues Resolved</h4>

<ul>
<li>224	Silverlight Support
<li>318	TestActionAttribute: Retrieving the TestFixture
<li>428	Add ExpectedExceptionAttribute to C# samples
<li>440	Automatic selection of Test Engine to use
<li>450	Create master install that includes the framework, engine and console installs
<li>477	Assert does not work with ArraySegment
<li>482	nunit-console has multiple errors related to -framework option
<li>483	Adds constraint for asserting that a dictionary contains a particular key
<li>484	Missing file in NUnit.Console nuget package
<li>485	Can't run v2 tests with nunit-console 3.0
<li>487	NUnitLite can't load assemblies by their file name
<li>488	Async setup and teardown still don't work
<li>497	Framework installer shold register the portable framework
<li>504	Option --workers:0 is ignored
<li>508	Travis builds with failure in engine tests show as successful
<li>509	Under linux, not all mono profiles are listed as available
<li>512	Drop the .NET 3.5 build
<li>517	V2 FrameworkDriver does not make use of passed in TestEventListener
<li>523	Provide an option to disable shadowcopy in NUnit v3
<li>528	V2 FrameworkDriver does not make use of passed in TestFilter
<li>530	Color display for Silverlight runner
<li>531	Display text output from tests in Silverlight runner
<li>534	Add classname and methodname to test result xml
<li>541	Console help doesn't indicate defaults
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 5 - January 30, 2015</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>A Windows installer is now included in the release packages.
</ul>
 
<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>TestCaseAttribute now allows arguments with default values to be omitted. Additionaly, it accepts IncludePlatform and ExcludePlatform properties to specify the platforms on which the test case should be run.
<li>TestFixture and TestCase attributes now enforce the requirement that a reason needs to be provided when ignoring a test.
<li>SetUp, TearDown, OneTimeSetUp and OneTimeTearDown methods may now be async.
<li>String arguments over 20 characters in length are truncated when used as part of a test name.
</ul>

<h4>Engine</h4>

<ul>
<li>The engine is now extensible using Mono.Addins. In this release, extension points are provided for FrameworkDrivers, ProjectLoaders and OutputWriters. The following addins are bundled as a part of NUnit:
  <ul>
  <li>A FrameworkDriver that allows running NUnit V2 tests under NUnit 3.0.
  <li>ProjectLoaders for NUnit and Visual Studio projects.
  <li>An OutputWriter that creates XML output in NUnit V2 format.
  </ul>
<li>DomainUsage now defaults to Multiple if not specified by the runner
</ul>

<h4>Console</h4>

<ul>
<li>New options supported:
  <ul>
  <li>--testlist provides a list of tests to run in a file
  <li>--stoponerror indicates that the run should terminate when any test fails.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Issues Resolved</h4>

<ul>
<li>20 TestCaseAttribute needs Platform property.
<li>60 NUnit should support async setup, teardown, fixture setup and fixture teardown.
<li>257  TestCaseAttribute should not require parameters with default values to be specified.
<li>266  Pluggable framework drivers.
<li>368  Create addin model.
<li>369  Project loader addins
<li>370  OutputWriter addins
<li>403  Move ConsoleOptions.cs and Options.cs to Common and share...
<li>419  Create Windows Installer for NUnit.
<li>427  [TestFixture(Ignore=true)] should not be allowed.
<li>437  Errors in tests under Linux due to hard-coded paths.
<li>441  NUnit-Console should support --testlist option
<li>442  Add --stoponerror option back to nunit-console.
<li>456  Fix memory leak in RuntimeFramework.
<li>459  Remove the Mixed Platforms build configuration.
<li>468  Change default domain usage to multiple.
<li>469  Truncate string arguments in test names in order to limit the length.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>ApartmentAttribute has been added, replacing STAAttribute and MTAAttribute.
<li>Unnecessary overloads of Assert.That and Assume.That have been removed.
<li>Multiple SetUpFixtures may be specified in a single namespace.
<li>The Pairwise strategy test case generation algorithm has been improved.
</ul>

<h4>Engine</h4>

<ul>
<li>A driver is now included, which allows running NUnit 2.x tests under NUnit 3.0.
<li>The engine can now load and run tests specified in a number of project formats:
  <ul>
   <li>NUnit (.nunit)
   <li>Visual Studio C# projects (.csproj)
   <li>Visual Studio F# projects (.vjsproj)
   <li>Visual Studio Visual Basic projects (.vbproj)
   <li>Visual Studio solutions (.sln)

   service of the engine, available to any runner.

<h3>NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 3 - November 29, 2014</h3>

<h4>Breaking Changes</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnitLite tests must reference both the nunit.framework and nunitlite assemblies.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>The NUnit and NUnitLite frameworks have now been merged. There is no longer any distinction
   between them in terms of features, although some features are not available on all platforms.
<li>The release includes two new framework builds: compact framework 3.5 and portable. The portable
   library is compatible with .NET 4.5, Silverlight 5.0, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8.1,
   Windows Phone Silverlight 8, Mono for Android and MonoTouch.
<li>A number of previously unsupported features are available for the Compact Framework:
  <ul>
    <li>Generic methods as tests
    <li>RegexConstraint
    <li>TimeoutAttribute
    <li>FileAssert, DirectoryAssert and file-related constraints
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Engine</h4>

<ul>
<li>The logic of runtime selection has now changed so that each assembly runs by default
   in a separate process using the runtime for which it was built.
<li>On 64-bit systems, each test process is automatically created as 32-bit or 64-bit,
   depending on the platform specified for the test assembly. 
</ul>

<h4>Console</h4>

<ul>
<li>The console runner now runs tests in a separate process per assembly by default. They may
   still be run in process or in a single separate process by use of command-line options.
<li>The console runner now starts in the highest version of the .NET runtime available, making
   it simpler to debug tests by specifying that they should run in-process on the command-line.
<li>The -x86 command-line option is provided to force execution in a 32-bit process on a 64-bit system.
<li>A writeability check is performed for each output result file before trying to run the tests.
<li>The -teamcity option is now supported.
</ul>

<h4>Issues Resolved</h4>

<ul>
 <li>12   Compact framework should support generic methods
 <li>145  NUnit-console fails if test result message contains invalid xml characters
 <li>155  Create utility classes for platform-specific code

 <li>293  CF does not have a CurrentDirectory
 <li>306  Assure NUnit can write resultfile
 <li>308  Early disposal of runners

 <li>325  Add RegexConstraint to compact framework build
 <li>326  Add TimeoutAttribute to compact framework build
 <li>327  Allow generic test methods in the compact framework

 <li>336  Document use of separate obj directories per build in our projects
 <li>337  Update Standard Defines page for .NET 3.0
 <li>341  Move the NUnitLite runners to separate assemblies
 <li>367  Refactor XML Escaping Tests
 <li>372  CF Build TestAsesemblyRunnerTests
